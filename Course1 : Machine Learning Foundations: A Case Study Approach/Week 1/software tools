There are many excellent machine learning libraries in Python.  
One of the most popular one today is scikit-learn. 
Similarly, there are many tools for data manipulations in Python; a popular example is Pandas.  
However, most of these tools do not scale to large datasets, including some we will tackle in this specialization. 
In addition, in this specialization, we will cover a wide range of ML models, feature engineering transformation, and evaluation metrics. 
With most existing packages, you will have to install a combination of packages to get the tools that we need to tackle the use cases in this course.  
This is possible, but requires advanced knowledge of Python, which we feel will slow down most people's learning of the core concepts.
